If you are reading this, you have uncrompressed the Bartender package
to a directory.

Before installing

If you do not need support for the XTC trajectory format, 
Bartender doesn't have any requirement beyond the xtb 
program. If you do need XTC support, then the nsl library
is needed. The also required xdrfile library is shipped
with Bartender.

Installation

I'll assume the current directory is where you want to
install Bartender. If not, move all the uncompressed files to the
installation directory

Say you your installation directory is /home/alfred/bartender

Read and (if needed)  modify the bartender_config.sh file, in 
the installation directory.  After you have done so, go 
back to your home directory and define the required environment variables

If you are using Bash:

        cd
        echo "export BTROOT=/home/alfred/bartender" >> .bashrc  
        echo "source $BTROOT/packagetools/bartender_config.sh" >> .bashrc
 
If you are using zsh, the last to lines will be:

        echo "export BTROOT=/home/alfred/bartender" >> .zshrc  
        echo "source $BTROOT/packagetools/bartender_config.sh" >> .zshrc



After you, for Bash:

        source .bashrc

Or, for zsh:
        source .zshrc

Bartender should be now ready to use.

The binary name is "bartender". If you need xtc-trajectory support,
use the "bartender-xtc" binary.
